// Chapter 1 take aways //

// All data is stored as long sequences of bits and is thus fundamentally alike //

// Any piece of discrete information can be reduced to ones and zeros and is represented in bits //

/* In order to maange the vast number of bits and not get lost in the memory/storage device we sperate them
 in to chunks that will represnt the info. JavaScript use whats called values when you create a value you will cuse the memory 
 in your computer to fire up*/

 // Values/basic data types in javaScript  //
 /* 1. Numbers  
    2. Strings
        You create a value with strings three ways
         1. '' single quotes
         2. "" double quotes
         3. `` backticks 
         as long as the value that you create ends with the same method that you started the string with.
         Strings in javaScript are stil stored in the memory as bits javaScript will convert the string value
         using the Unicode standard. This will do it virtually for every character.
